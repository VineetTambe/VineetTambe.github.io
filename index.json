We present an analysis on design metrics like perception, communication and computation layers for a ‚Äúconstrained environment‚Äù. An environment with limited resources such as - limited power, bandwidth, compute, memory etc. can be classified as a constrained environment. Based on our literature survey we have also presented a study that shows multi-path routing is more efficient than single-path and the retransmission mechanism is not preferable in an IoT environment. We have also tested the performance of standard security algorithms on different computational architectures and discuss the implications of the results. Empirical results demonstrate that encryption \u0026 decryption times increase non-linearly rather than linearly as message size increases.","tags":["research","journal","IoT","resource-constrained environments"],"title":"Reliability and Availability of IoT Devices in Resource-Constrained Environments.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vineet Tambe","Atreyee Saha","Arjun Ghose","Aman Pande","Neha Sharma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628121600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628121600,"objectID":"c46d6991804f343efda0b08b9d63ce02","permalink":"https://VineetTambe.github.io/publication/covid19_paper/","publishdate":"2021-08-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/covid19_paper/","section":"publication","summary":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected the globe on an unprecedented scale, bringing the world to its knees. Healthcare systems across the globe have been placed under severe levels of stress due to the rising number of infections, especially in India. This paper aims to study the availability of healthcare resources in India in terms of infrastructure and human resources, in order to understand the dangers posed by increasing coronavirus infections. Prediction models have also been built to capture the trend in the rising number of confirmed cases for COVID-19. Data on the healthcare infrastructure and human resources for India have been analyzed and compared with the World Health Organization‚Äôs recommendations for the same. Prediction models, namely long short-term memory, ARIMA, Prophet, and exponential smoothing, have been used to make short-term predictions for COVID-19 cases. This paper finds that only 14% of India‚Äôs states have sufficient number of hospital beds and 50% have sufficient number of doctors. All of the models predicted a continued increase in the number of cases, with the ARIMA model performing the best.","tags":["research","journal","covid-19","forecasting"],"title":"Analyzing the Supply of Healthcare Human Resource and Infrastructure of India to Handle COVID-19 cases and Building a Prediction Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"6ed2c92e876d14f09933ff39bc3a4824","permalink":"https://VineetTambe.github.io/project/low_latency_5g_aws/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/low_latency_5g_aws/","section":"project","summary":"Building a low latency application using Amazon-Wavelength and Verizon-5G","tags":["Demo"],"title":"Low latency health monitoring system using Amazon-Wavelength and Verizon-5G","type":"project"},{"authors":["Neha Sharma","Santanu Ghosh","Monodeep Saha","Vineet Tambe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":160704e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":160704e4,"objectID":"52fb8409dd060c917889187a8e4408e5","permalink":"https://VineetTambe.github.io/publication/covid19_chapter/","publishdate":"2020-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/covid19_chapter/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["research","chapter","covid-19","forecasting"],"title":"Open Data for Sustainable Community: Chapter 8 \u0026 9","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602979200,"objectID":"d93552a248d518eb865cb8d2ecee042a","permalink":"https://VineetTambe.github.io/project/robocon2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/robocon2020/","section":"project","summary":"Watch these videos!!
